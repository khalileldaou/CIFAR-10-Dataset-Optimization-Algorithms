# CIFAR-10-Dataset-Optimization-Algorithms
Assessed 4 different optimizers including SGD, Adam, evolutionary algorithms and NSGAII and modified the SGD optimizer to maximize performance and achieve faster convergence. 

In image classification, selecting the appropriate optimisation algorithm to train the weights of a neural network is key to achieving good performance. This work explores different types of existing optimizers such as gradient descent based algorithms and evolutionary algorithms. Then, modifications of leading optimizer SGD were carried out in order to maximise accuracy on the CIFAR10 image dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network. A separate approach was tested where both the accuracy and the sum of the square weights were optimized as a bi-objective problem.
